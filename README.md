# My Nix Home Manager Configuration

This is a comprehensive configuration of my development environment using [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) based on the [nix package manager](https://github.com/NixOS/nix).

It features the following major components:

- [kitty terminal emulator](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
- [neovim editor](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- [zsh shell](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh)
- [starship prompt](https://github.com/starship/starship)
- *many other tools used for developmentâ€¦*

***Disclaimer: This is my personal configuration and without major changes this is not properly usable for somebody else.***
